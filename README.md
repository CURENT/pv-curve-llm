# TODO
- [ ] Improve `/agent` documentation
- [ ] Improve prompts in `agent/prompts.json`
- [X] Create function to generate PV Curves using inputs from `agent/inputs.json` (See `agents/pv_curve`)
- [X] Add documentation/graph for agentic workflow
- [X] Add LangGraph node to generate PV curve
- [X] Add LangGraph node to review PV curve and process user feedback
- [ ] Research/review legality of the data stored in `agent/data` in Open-Source repo. More info in `agent/data/README.md` 
- [ ] Add API implementation of `/agent` that is run on `server/server.py` for UI interaction
- [ ] UI documentation
- [ ] Consolidate documentation in main `README.md`
- [ ] Experiment with HPC for improved LLM performance
- [ ] Add simpler script to download and run project
- [ ] Add documentation to explain file structure/project architecture
- [ ] Create Demo

# Installation & Run
Currently only `/agent/main.py` is ready for local testing. See `/agent/README.md` for more information.
