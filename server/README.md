# TODO

The old implementation of server.py has been deprecated when moved to the new repository under /CURENT with the new
agent-based architecture. The Next.js frontend will not yet work until this implementation is complete.

## Run Instructions

```bash
cd /server
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
