# LLMs on Clemson's Palmetto (HPC)

LLM on Palmetto Tutorial: https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/llms_inference/01-background.html

Palmetto will likely be great for experimenting with high performance computing and running better LLMs on dedicated GPUs for improved performance, but is not suitable for open source as it requires certain access credentials.
