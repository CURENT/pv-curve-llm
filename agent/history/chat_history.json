          "assistant_response": "A PV curve in power systems is a Power‐Voltage curve used in voltage stability studies. It is constructed by plotting the voltage magnitude at a critical bus (or area) against progressively increasing real power (load) levels. As the load increases, the curve typically shows a \"nose\" point, which marks the maximum loadability limit—the critical threshold where any additional load could trigger a sudden voltage drop or collapse. This tool helps operators and analysts assess how close the system is to voltage instability and plan corrective actions accordingly.",
